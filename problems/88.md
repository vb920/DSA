# 88. Merge Sorted Array
🔁 Iteration 1

**Pattern:** Two Pointers 

**Difficulty:** Easy 

**Time:** 5m

**Solo:** Y

### 🧠 Core Logic
* **The Trick:** first array has empty space use that ; by filling in from maximum element
* **Execution:**
  1. Compare values: Append maximum element, reduce its pointer.
  2. Flush remaining elements from second array only.
* **Complexity:** 

Time `O(N + M)`

 Space `O(1)`

### 🚨 Traps & Bugs
* **Edge Case:** Handle the bigger array pointer first in while loop ; not in nested.
* **My Bugs:** None. Cleanly handled the `<`, `>`, and `==` conditions.

### 🎤 1-Sentence Pitch
* "Instead of an `O((N+M))` space, we optimize to `O(1)` using **Two Pointers** by leveraging the pre-sorted input."
