# 2390. Removing Stars From a String

🔁 **Iteration 1**

**Pattern:** Stack (backspace simulation)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time:** 8m  
**Solo:** Y optimal

### 🧠 Core Logic

*   **The Trick:** Treat `'*'` as a **backspace** that removes the most recent kept character. Maintain a LIFO buffer: **push** letters, **pop** on `'*'`. This ensures the frontier is always fully reduced.
*   **Execution:**
    1.  Initialize empty stack/buffer.
    2.  For each `ch` in `s`:
        *   If `ch == '*'` → **pop** the last kept char.
        *   Else **push** `ch`.
    3.  Build the output from the buffer (reverse if using stack semantics).
*   **Complexity:**  
    Time `O(N)`  
    Space `O(N)`

### 🚨 Traps & Bugs

*   **Safety:** `pop()` assumes a prior character exists—LC guarantees this; add a guard if reusing elsewhere.
*   **Structure:** `ArrayDeque<Character>` or a `StringBuilder` grow/shrink buffer (with `setLength(len-1)`) is faster than legacy `Stack`.
*   **Order:** If you push/pop as a stack, **reverse** at the end; using a builder as a stack avoids extra reversal.
*   **Stress:** Large inputs favor the builder approach to avoid boxing overhead.

### 🎤 1‑Sentence Pitch

Simulate backspaces with a LIFO buffer so each character is pushed or popped at most once, yielding an `O(N)` clean reduction.
