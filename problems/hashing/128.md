# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

🔁 Iteration 1

**Pattern:** Hashing / Set + Sequence Starts

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Time:** 12m

**Solo:** Y Brute / N optimal

### 🧠 Core Logic

*   **The Trick:** put all numbers in a **set** and only start a streak when you see a **sequence start** (`x-1` not in set); then **expand right** (`x+1, x+2, …`) to count length
*   **Execution:**
    1.  insert all elements into a `HashSet` for `O(1)` average membership tests
    2.  for each `x` in set, if `(x - 1)` not in set → this `x` starts a new sequence
    3.  advance `y = x` while `(y + 1)` in set, incrementing `streak`
    4.  track `maxStreak` over all starts; return it
*   **Complexity:**

Time `O(n)` (each number is visited at most twice across all expansions)

Space `O(n)` (the set)

### 🚨 Traps & Bugs

*   **Edge Case:** empty array should return **`0`** — initialize `maxStreak = 0` (your current `count = 1` would return `1` on empty input)
*   **Duplicates:** fine—set removes duplicates so they don’t inflate streaks
*   **Negatives & gaps:** fully supported; ordering doesn’t matter
*   **My Bugs:** logic is solid and optimal; earlier **TreeSet + iterative lookup** is `O(n log n)` (sorted scan), but the **set + start-only expansion** is the intended `O(n)` solution

### 🎤 1-Sentence Pitch

*   “Store all values in a set and grow runs only from numbers without a predecessor so each sequence is counted once—linear time, linear space.”
