# 2956. Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays

🔁 Iteration 1

**Pattern:** Hashing

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Time:** 5m

**Solo:** Y optimal

### 🧠 Core Logic

*   **The Trick:** build **presence sets** for both arrays; **count per occurrence** by checking membership in the opposite set
*   **Execution:**
    1.  insert all values of `nums1` into `st1` and all values of `nums2` into `st2`
    2.  for each `x` in `nums1`, if `x ∈ st2` → `count1++`
    3.  for each `y` in `nums2`, if `y ∈ st1` → `count2++`
    4.  return `[count1, count2]`
*   **Complexity:**

Time `O(n1 + n2)`

Space `O(n1 + n2)`

### 🚨 Traps & Bugs

*   **Edge Case:** counts are **per occurrence**, not distinct; empty arrays → zeros; negatives/zeros fine; order doesn’t matter
*   **My Bugs:** none; built sets first and used membership checks symmetrically (no off-by-one / self-pair issues)

### 🎤 1-Sentence Pitch

*   “Build sets for fast membership and scan both arrays—linear time, with duplicates correctly counted by design.”
