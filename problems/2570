# 2570. Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values
🔁 Iteration 1

**Pattern:** Two Pointers 

**Difficulty:** Easy 

**Time:** 10m

**Solo:** Y

### 🧠 Core Logic
* **The Trick:** Arrays are already sorted -> Skip the HashMap, use Two Pointers.
* **Execution:**
  1. Compare IDs: Append smaller ID, advance its pointer.
  2. If IDs match: Sum values, append, advance *both* pointers.
  3. Flush remaining elements from both arrays.
* **Complexity:** 

Time `O(N + M)`

 Space `O(N + M)`

### 🚨 Traps & Bugs
* **Edge Case:** Arrays of different lengths (trailing `while` loops are required).
* **My Bugs:** None. Cleanly handled the `<`, `>`, and `==` conditions.

### 🎤 1-Sentence Pitch
* "Instead of an `O((N+M) log(N+M))` TreeMap, we optimize to `O(N + M)` using **Two Pointers** by leveraging the pre-sorted input."
