# 905. Sort Array By Parity
**Pattern:** Two Pointers | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Time:** 5m | **Solo:** Y (Brute) / N (Optimal)

### 🧠 Core Logic
* **The Trick:** First even then odd. To do it without extra space, swap them in-place.
* **Execution:**
  1. Left pointer at start, right pointer at reverse (end).
  2. If left is odd and right is even -> Swap them.
  3. Move left forward if it's even, move right backward if it's odd.
* **Complexity:** Time `O(N)` | Space `O(1)`

### 🚨 Traps & Bugs
* **Edge Case:** Handle the empty array (or array of size 1).
* **My Bugs:** Got stuck on `O(N)` space. Couldn't optimize the in-place swap in 5 mins.

### 🎤 1-Sentence Pitch
* "My brute force used a new empty array for `O(N)` space by putting evens from the start and odds from the reverse. We optimize to `O(1)` space using **Two Pointers** at opposite ends to just swap the misaligned elements in-place."
